			<p>The next day the Wolf came again, and said to the little Pig, "Little Pig, there is a Fair in the Town this afternoon: will you go?"</p>
			<div style="page-break-inside: avoid;width: 100%;max-width:301px;margin: 0 auto;"><img src="../images/img16.jpg"/></div>
			<p>"Oh, yes," said the Pig, "I will go; what time shall you be ready?"</p>
			<p>"At three," said the Wolf.</p>
			<div style="page-break-inside: avoid;width: 100%;max-width:275px;margin: 0 auto;"><img src="../images/img17.jpg"/></div>
			<p>So the little Pig went off before the time, as usual, and got to the Fair, and bought a butter churn, and was on his way home with it when he saw the Wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and in doing so turned it round, and it began to roll, and rolled down the hill with the Pig inside it, which frightened the Wolf so much that he ran home without going to the Fair.</p>
